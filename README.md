## Motivation

This project was designed to demo the integration of Commerce.js and Stripe.js into a React.js app to streamline storefront/cart/checkout creation. Commerce.js offers a headless, customizable eCommerce platform that simplifies the development process by offering back-end functionality through its API. Stripe.js is a JavaScript library for building payment flows by tokenizing user sensitive information. Best of all, Commerce.js and Stripe.js can be easily used in tandem, completely eliminating the need for a server or database!

## Features

- Add item(s) to cart
- View/update/remove/empty cart items
- User checkout with name, email, address, and credit card
- Checkout displays order summary and subtotal before payment submission
- Most recent session order can be viewed at any time from the navbar
- Robust error handling that informs users what problem(s) occurred
- Fully responsive, mobile-friendly design
- Customer and merchant receive emails with order information
